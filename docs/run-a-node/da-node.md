# Data Availability Node
---
While there are various approaches to running a DA (Data Availability) node, this guide outlines our recommended method and the necessary hardware specifications. DA Nodes performs the core functions of verifying, signing, and storing encoded blob data. It's important to note that your DA signer needs to operate a DA node to verify encoded blob data, sign it, and store it for future farming and rewards. Currently, in order to run a DA Node on Testnet, users must stake 10 A0GI tokens. These can be obtained via our [faucet](https://faucet.0g.ai/) or via rewards from running Storage Nodes or Validator Nodes. You can also reach out to our technical moderators on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/0glabs).

## Hardware Requirements

| Node Type | Memory | CPU | Disk | Bandwidth | Additional Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----|------|-----------|------------------|
| DA Node | 16 GB | 8 cores | 1 TB NVME SSD | 100 MBps | For Download / Upload |


## Standing up a DA Node and DA Signer
<Tabs>

  <TabItem value="Da-node-docker" label="Run with Docker" default>

**1. Clone the DA Node Repo:** 

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/0glabs/0g-da-node.git
   cd 0g-da-node
   ```

**2. Generate BLS Private Key (if needed):**

If you don't have a BLS private key, generate one:

```
cargo run --bin key-gen
```

Keep the generated BLS private key secure.

**3. Set up config.toml:**

1. Change the example file name from `config_example.toml` to `config.toml` and change the settings:
   
   ```toml
   cp $HOME/0g-da-node/run/config_example.toml $HOME/0g-da-node/run/config.toml
   nano $HOME/0g-da-node/config.toml
   ```

2. Add the following content to the file, adjusting values as needed:

   ```toml
   log_level = "info"

   data_path = "/data"

   # path to downloaded params folder
   encoder_params_dir = "/params"

   # grpc server listen address
   grpc_listen_address = "0.0.0.0:34000"
   # chain eth rpc endpoint
   eth_rpc_endpoint = "https://rpc-testnet.0g.ai"
   # public grpc service socket address to register in DA contract
   # ip:34000 (keep same port as the grpc listen address)
   # or if you have dns, fill your dns
   socket_address = "<your_server_ip>:34000"

   # data availability contract to interact with
   da_entrance_address = "0x857C0A28A8634614BB2C96039Cf4a20AFF709Aa9" # testnet config
   # deployed block number of da entrance contract
   start_block_number = 940000 # testnet config

   # signer BLS private key
   signer_bls_private_key = ""
   # signer eth account private key
   signer_eth_private_key = ""
   # miner eth account private key, (could be the same as `signer_eth_private_key`, but not recommended)
   miner_eth_private_key = ""

   # whether to enable data availability sampling
   enable_das = "true"
   ```

   Make sure to fill in the `signer_bls_private_key`, `signer_eth_private_key`, and `miner_eth_private_key` fields with your actual private keys.

**4. Build and Start the Docker Container:**

   ```
   docker build -t 0g-da-node .
   docker run -d --name 0g-da-node 0g-da-node
   ```
**5: Verify the Node is Running**

On the first run, the DA node will register the signer information in the DA contract. You can monitor the console output to ensure the node is running correctly and has successfully registered.

### Node Operations

As a DA node operator, your node will perform the following tasks:
- Encoded blob data verification
- Signing of verified data
- Storing blob data for further farming
- Receiving rewards for these operations

### Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues, check the console output for error messages.
- Ensure that the ports specified in your `config.toml` file are not being used by other applications.
- Verify that you have the latest stable version of Rust installed.
- Make sure your system meets the minimum hardware requirements.

### Conclusion

You have now successfully set up and run a 0g DA node as a DA Signer. For more advanced configuration options and usage instructions, please refer to the official GitHub repository.

Remember to keep your private keys secure and regularly update your node software to ensure optimal performance and security.

<TabItem value="signer" label="Become a Signer">

## Overview

The DASigners contract is an interface through which Solidity contracts can interact with the 0G chain module DASigners. It is registered as a precompiled contract, similar to other precompiled EVM extensions.

## Becoming a DA Signer

To become a DA signer, you must meet the following requirements:

1. Delegation Requirement: To become a signer, an address must receive enough delegations, equivalent to at least the TokensPerVote amount of A0GI tokens (10 tokens per vote in the testnet), registered in the DASigners module.

2. Node Operation: Each signer needs to run a DA (Data Availability) node that verifies blob encoding and generates BLS signatures for signed blobs.

3. Registration: Signers must register their information using the registerSigner function. This includes providing their address, node socket address, BLS public key, and a signature signed by their BLS private key.

4. Epoch Participation: Signers must submit a registration message (using the registerNextEpoch function) with a signature for each epoch they wish to participate in. This is necessary for joining quorums in the next epoch.

5. Voting Power: Each signerâ€™s voting power is determined by the number of tokens delegated to them. Signers can have up to 1024 votes, and the votes are distributed randomly into quorums.

6. Quorum Responsibilities: Each signer in a quorum is responsible for validating, signing, and storing a specific row of encoded blob data during an epoch.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Git
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Contract Details

**Address**: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001000`

### Contract Params (Testnet)

```
TokensPerVote = 10
MaxVotesPerSigner = 1024
MaxQuorums = 10
EpochBlocks = 5760
EncodedSlices = 3072
```

## Terminology

### Signer

A Signer is an address with sufficient delegations (at least `TokensPerVote` A0GI) registered in the DASigners module. Each signer should run a DA node to verify DA blob encoding and generate BLS signatures for signed blobs. The BLS curve used is BN254, and the public keys of signers are registered in the contract.

**Note**: For accounts with delegations to more than 10 validators, only 10 of these delegations are counted and accumulated.

### Epoch

The consecutive blocks in the 0g chain are divided into groups of `EpochBlocks`, and each group is an epoch.

### Quorum

In an epoch, there can be up to `MaxQuorums` quorums. Each quorum is a list of signer addresses with size `EncodedSlices`. The i-th signer in the quorum is responsible for validating, signing, and storing the i-th row of the encoded blob data assigned to this quorum.

### Vote

Signers can submit their signatures on a registration message to request joining the quorums in the next epoch. At the start of each epoch, the DASigners module calculates the voting power for registered signers based on their delegated token amounts. Each delegated `TokensPerVote` A0GI counts as one vote, and each signer can have up to `MaxVotesPerSigner` votes. All votes are then randomly ordered and distributed into quorums.

## Interface

Find the Solidity interface in the [0g-da-contract repo](https://github.com/0glabs/0g-da-contract).

## ABI

Find the ABI in the [0g-chain repo](https://github.com/0glabs/0g-chain).

## Transactions

### registerSigner

Register signer's information, including signer address, DA node service socket address, signer BLS public key on G1 and G2 group, and a signature signed by the BLS private key of the following message:

```
Keccak256(signerAddress, chainID, "0G_BN254_Pubkey_Registration")
```

Here `chainID` is left-padded to 32 bytes by zeros.

```solidity
function registerSigner(
    SignerDetail memory _signer, 
    BN254.G1Point memory _signature
) external;
```

### updateSocket

Update signer's socket address.

```solidity
function updateSocket(string memory _socket) external;
```

### registerNextEpoch

Register to join the quorums in the next epoch. The signer needs to submit a signature signed by their BLS private key:

```
Keccak256(signerAddress, epoch, chainID)
```

Here `chainID` is left-padded to 32 bytes by zeros and `epoch` is an unsigned 64-bit number in big-endian format.

```solidity
function registerNextEpoch(BN254.G1Point memory _signature) external;
```
